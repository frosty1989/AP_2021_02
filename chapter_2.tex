\section{Laser Shock Peening}

Laser Shock Peening (LSP) treatment induces residual stresses beneath the treated surface of metallic materials. The residual stresses are produced by a high magnitude shock wave induced by a high-energy laser pulse. The advantage of LSP is that the laser pulse can be adjusted and controlled in real time. A computer-controlled system can measure the energy per pulse and record it for each LSP process on the component [Mannava 1998].

\subsection{Laser Shock Peening Process}
The configuration of an LSP process on a metallic component is shown in Figure \ref{fig:lspconfiguration}. An intense pulsed laser shock beam is fired onto a metal surface for a brief time (10-100 ns). The heated zone is vaporized and transformed to plasma by ionization due to high temperatures (over 10 000 °C). The plasma is under high pressure, which propagates through the material via shock waves. Two modes of LSP exist – the direct ablation mode and the confined ablation mode. The direct ablation mode refers to the interaction of plasma with metal without coating and confinement. Plasma pressure of tenths of a GPa is achieved using direct ablation mode. Higher pressures of 5-10 GPa can be obtained using the confined mode. In the confined mode, the metal surface is usually coated with an opaque material such as black paint or aluminium foil and confined by a material transparent to the laser radiation such as distilled water or borosilicate glass. A stronger pressure pulse results in a higher magnitude of compressive residual stress to a deeper depth.

\subsection{Laser Shock Peening Strategy}
During the peening process, a pattern is created made of individual laser pulses. Generally, multiple sequences of the pattern that are gradually shifted across the sample are used to create a layer, as seen in Figure No . The pattern shifting ensures a more homogeneous residual stress distribution. This peening strategy's disadvantage is that the protective coating needs to be replaced in between sequences.

\section{Laser Shock Peening Station}

The LSP station uses the Bivoj laser system, located on the ground floor of the HiLASE Centre. A Laser Beam Distribution System (LBDS) transports the beam to
experimental laboratories on the 1\textsuperscript{st} floor. The Bivoj laser
system is a Diode Pumped Solid State Laser (DPSSL) based on
Yb-doped gain media with a laser wavelength of 1030 nm
capable of delivering energy pulses up to 8 J at a 10 Hz
repetition rate. The beam shape at the output of the Bivoj laser is a
square flat-top pulse. The two main parts of the Bivoj laser are
the front-end and the 10 J amplifier.
